                <p>Hello, my name is Kathleen but Katie works best. I’m currently on round 2 of college after many years working in the real world. It was boring. <br> I enjoy beer, coffee, reading, sci-fi and running. I have 2 cats and a retired greyhound named Starbuck and she’s not named for coffee. It’s nice to be back in college, learning new things and meeting new people.</p>
